Its distinctive appearance resembles a wagon wheel, with a bright central hub surrounded by a ring of young stars about 150,000 light-years in diameter. This unusual structure is the result of a high-speed collision with a smaller galaxy that passed through the Cartwheel''s center about 200-300 million years ago, creating a shock wave that swept gas outward and triggered star formation in the ring. The galaxy is still recovering from this collision, with the ring continuing to expand at about 200,000 miles per hour. Between the central nucleus and the outer ring lies a region containing significant amounts of gas but relatively few stars.

It derives its name from its elongated, cigar-like shape when viewed from Earth. M82 is undergoing an exceptional rate of star formation, about 10 times higher than in the Milky Way, triggered by a close encounter with the nearby galaxy M81 about 100-300 million years ago. This intense activity has resulted in superheated gas being expelled from the galaxy''s center at speeds of up to 1,000 kilometers per second, creating prominent filaments visible in X-ray and radio observations. Despite being relatively small at about 37,000 light-years across, M82 shines five times brighter than the entire Milky Way due to its starburst activity.

The galaxy spans about 65,000 light-years in diameter and contains approximately 100 billion stars. M64 has an unusual feature: the gas in the outer regions rotates in the opposite direction from the gas and stars in the inner regions. This counter-rotating structure is likely the result of a merger with a smaller satellite galaxy that occurred over a billion years ago. The collision zone between these counter-rotating regions is an area of active star formation.

This tail was formed approximately 100 million years ago when a smaller galaxy passed through the Tadpole, disrupting its structure through gravitational forces. The intruder galaxy, now visible as a bright blue clump, triggered intense star formation in both the main galaxy and the tail. The tail region contains numerous young star clusters that formed in the wake of the collision. Despite its disturbed appearance, the Tadpole Galaxy is expected to eventually settle back into a normal spiral shape after several hundred million years.

The ring, which is about 70,000 light-years in diameter, contains many massive, newly formed stars. The unusual structure of Hoag''s Object has puzzled astronomers for decades, as most ring galaxies form through collisions, but Hoag''s Object shows no signs of a recent merger. Theories for its formation include a past collision that left no trace, an internal bar structure that dissolved over time, or accretion of material from a companion galaxy.

NGC 2207, the larger of the two, is in the process of tidally stripping material from the smaller IC 2163. This ongoing interaction, which began about 40 million years ago, has created distinctive features in both galaxies: NGC 2207''s spiral arms have been enhanced and distorted, while IC 2163 has developed an eye-shaped tidal tail on its far side. Computer simulations suggest the smaller galaxy completed a close pass behind NGC 2207 and is now moving away, but the galaxies remain gravitationally bound and will eventually merge. The collision has triggered significant star formation throughout both galaxies. Remarkably, three supernovae have been observed in NGC 2207 within the past 25 years (SN 1975A, SN 1999ec, and SN 2003H), making this system particularly valuable for studying how galaxy interactions affect stellar evolution.', 34, 'superuser');

CALL insert_content_revision('The Backward Galaxy (NGC 4622) is a spiral galaxy located approximately 111 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Centaurus. It earned its nickname due to its unusual rotation pattern: unlike most spiral galaxies, NGC 4622 appears to be rotating in the opposite direction to what its spiral arms suggest. The galaxy has two prominent outer arms that point clockwise and one inner arm that points counterclockwise, but detailed studies indicate it rotates counterclockwise—against the winding direction of its outer arms. This rare ''leading arm'' structure challenges standard models of galaxy formation and evolution. NGC 4622 spans about 80,000 light-years in diameter and likely acquired its unusual structure through a past merger or interaction with another galaxy, though no obvious companion is currently visible. The galaxy was discovered by William Herschel in 1834 and has since become an important case study in understanding the diversity of spiral galaxy structures and the mechanisms that shape them.', 39, 'superuser');

This exceptional supernova production rate, about one every decade, is roughly 10 times higher than in a typical galaxy. NGC 6946 spans about 40,000 light-years in diameter and is oriented at an angle of about 30 degrees from our line of sight. The galaxy has a small, bright nucleus, multiple spiral arms, and is undergoing vigorous star formation throughout its disk.

The galaxy spans about 100,000 light-years in diameter and features a prominent dust lane bisecting its disk. This dust lane is composed of interstellar gas and dust that blocks light from stars behind it. Despite its narrow appearance from our perspective, NGC 4565 is actually a massive barred spiral galaxy similar in size to the Milky Way. Its central bulge contains a small active galactic nucleus powered by a supermassive black hole.

It is notable for being one of the largest known spiral galaxies, with its spiral arms spanning approximately 522,000 light-years from tip to tip—about five times the size of the Milky Way. This enormous size is likely the result of an ongoing interaction with the smaller lenticular galaxy IC 4970, which can be seen near NGC 6872''s central bar. The collision has triggered star formation along the stretched spiral arms, particularly in the northern arm where clusters of young, blue stars are prominent. Computer simulations suggest the interaction began about 130 million years ago when IC 4970 passed through NGC 6872''s disk.

Discovered in 1986 by David Malin, it is one of the largest known spiral galaxies, with a diameter of about 650,000 light-years—more than six times larger than the Milky Way. Despite its enormous size, Malin 1 remained undetected until relatively recently because its stars are spread so thinly that the galaxy''s overall brightness is extremely low. The galaxy has a small, bright central region surrounded by a vast, diffuse disk of stars and gas. Malin 1 contains enough gas to form stars for trillions of years but does so at a very slow rate.

Regulus A has a close companion, a probable white dwarf that orbits it every 40 days, while a more distant pair of red dwarf stars, Regulus B and C, orbit the main pair at a much greater distance. The name "Regulus" comes from Latin and means "little king," reflecting its prominence in Leo, the lion constellation. Throughout history, Regulus has been significant in many cultures, often associated with royalty and power—the "Heart of the Lion" in many ancient traditions.', 129, 'superuser');
CALL insert_content_revision('Adhara, also known as Epsilon Canis Majoris, is the second-brightest star in the constellation Canis Major and the 22nd brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent magnitude of 1.50. Located approximately 430 light-years from Earth, Adhara is a binary star system whose primary component is a massive blue-white supergiant star about 12 times the Sun''s mass and 14 times its radius, with an extremely hot surface temperature of approximately 22,900 K. This high temperature makes Adhara one of the brightest stars in the sky in ultraviolet light, and if human eyes could see ultraviolet radiation, Adhara would appear as the brightest star in the night sky. The star''s companion is a much fainter star that orbits the primary at a significant distance. Adhara is estimated to be about 23 million years old and is already in an advanced stage of its evolution due to its high mass. The name "Adhara" comes from Arabic and means "virgins," possibly referring to a group of stars in this region of the sky. In ancient navigation, Adhara was an important star for sailors, particularly in the southern hemisphere, due to its brightness and position.', 130, 'superuser');

Located approximately 570 light-years from Earth, Shaula is actually a multiple star system consisting of at least three components. The primary star is a hot, blue-white giant about 14 times the Sun''s mass and 6 times its radius, with a surface temperature of approximately 25,000 K. It is classified as a Beta Cephei variable star, showing small variations in brightness over periods of about 5 hours due to pulsations in its outer layers. Shaula has a close companion that orbits it every 6 days, and a more distant third star completes the system. The name "Shaula" comes from Arabic and means "the raised tail," referring to its position at the end of the Scorpion''s tail in the constellation Scorpius. At only about 10-16 million years old, Shaula is a relatively young star that will likely end its life in a spectacular supernova explosion. Along with the star Lesath (Upsilon Scorpii), Shaula forms an asterism known as "the Sting" at the tip of the Scorpion''s tail.', 131, 'superuser');
CALL insert_content_revision('Castor, also known as Alpha Geminorum, is the second-brightest star in the constellation Gemini and the 23rd brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent magnitude of 1.58. Located approximately 51 light-years from Earth, Castor is a remarkable multiple star system consisting of six stars organized into three binary pairs. To the naked eye, Castor appears as a single star, but even a small telescope can resolve it into two components, Castor A and B, which are both spectroscopic binaries containing two stars each. A third, more distant component, Castor C (also known as YY Geminorum), is itself a binary system of two red dwarf stars that regularly eclipse each other. The primary stars in the system, Castor A and B, are both hot, blue-white main-sequence stars with masses about 2.4 and 1.9 times that of the Sun, respectively, while the Castor C pair consists of much cooler and less massive red dwarfs. The entire system orbits with extremely long periods—the A and B components take about 467 years to orbit each other, while C orbits the AB pair with a period of several thousand years. The name "Castor" comes from Greek mythology, where Castor was one of the twin sons of Zeus (the other being Pollux, represented by the neighboring star Beta Geminorum). Castor has been closely studied for centuries and provides valuable insights into stellar evolution in multiple star systems.', 132, 'superuser');

The star''s distinctive reddish appearance contrasts noticeably with the blue-white color of the other bright stars in the Southern Cross, making it easy to identify. Gacrux is actually a multiple star system, with a fainter companion star orbiting at a significant distance. At an estimated age of about 100-200 million years, Gacrux is in an advanced stage of stellar evolution and has already exhausted the hydrogen in its core. The name "Gacrux" is a modern contraction of "Gamma Crucis," combining the Greek letter designation with the constellation name. As part of the Southern Cross, one of the most recognizable asterisms in the southern hemisphere, Gacrux appears on the flags of several countries, including Australia, Brazil, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and Samoa. Due to its position near the top of the cross, it is sometimes referred to as the "head" of the Southern Cross.', 133, 'superuser');

Located approximately 250 light-years from Earth, Bellatrix is a massive blue-white giant star with about 8.6 times the Sun''s mass and 5.8 times its radius, with a surface temperature of approximately 22,000 K. Unlike many bright stars, Bellatrix is a single star rather than a multiple system. The star rotates relatively rapidly, completing one rotation in about 5 days, which is faster than many giants of its type. At an estimated age of 20 million years, Bellatrix is already in an advanced stage of evolution due to its high mass. The name "Bellatrix" comes from Latin and means "female warrior" or "amazon star," making it one of the few prominent stars with a feminine name. In the constellation Orion, Bellatrix marks the left shoulder of the hunter (or right shoulder as seen from Earth) and is sometimes called the "Amazon Star." In Harry Potter lore, the name gained additional recognition as the name of a character. In navigation, Bellatrix has been important historically due to its brightness and distinctive position in one of the most recognizable constellations in the night sky.', 134, 'superuser');

Located approximately 134 light-years from Earth, Elnath is a blue-white giant star with about 4.5 times the Sun''s mass and 4.2 times its radius, with a surface temperature of approximately 13,800 K. The star occupies a unique position in the night sky, as it was historically considered to be part of both the Taurus and Auriga constellations, marking the northern horn of the bull and the southern foot of the charioteer, respectively. Modern constellation boundaries, however, place it officially in Taurus. The name "Elnath" (or "El Nath") comes from Arabic and means "the butting one," referring to its position at the tip of one of the bull''s horns. At an estimated age of about 100 million years, Elnath is still relatively young and will eventually evolve into a much larger red giant before ending its life as a massive white dwarf. Despite its brightness, Elnath has received less attention than many other bright stars in scientific research and cultural references, possibly due to its somewhat isolated position away from major asterisms or notable deep sky objects.', 135, 'superuser');

The star is in a transitional evolutionary phase, having recently exhausted the hydrogen in its core and begun to expand as it moves off the main sequence. Miaplacidus is a relatively fast rotator, completing one rotation in about 1.5 days, which contributes to its slight equatorial bulge. The name "Miaplacidus" has an unusual origin, derived from Arabic and Latin elements meaning "the placid waters," though there is some scholarly debate about the exact etymology. Located in the southern sky, Miaplacidus is not visible to observers in the northern mid-latitudes and higher, making it a significant navigation star primarily for southern hemisphere sailors and travelers. The star was historically part of the larger constellation Argo Navis (the ship Argo), which was later divided into the modern constellations Carina (the keel), Puppis (the stern), and Vela (the sails). At about 260 million years old, Miaplacidus is in its middle age and will eventually evolve into a red giant before ending its life as a white dwarf.', 136, 'superuser');

The star is one of the most luminous stars known, shining with a luminosity roughly 375,000 times that of the Sun. If placed at a distance of 10 parsecs (the standard distance for absolute magnitude), Alnilam would outshine Venus in our sky. The name "Alnilam" comes from Arabic and means "string of pearls," referring to its position in Orion''s Belt alongside the stars Alnitak and Mintaka. At only about 5-10 million years old, Alnilam is a very young star, but due to its enormous mass, it has already evolved into the supergiant phase and will likely explode as a supernova within the next million years. The star is surrounded by a molecular cloud, NGC 1990, which it illuminates, creating a reflection nebula. Alnilam is losing mass rapidly through stellar winds, shedding material at a rate about 20 million times greater than the Sun''s solar wind. As part of Orion''s Belt, one of the most recognizable asterisms in the night sky, Alnilam has been significant in the mythology and celestial navigation of cultures worldwide for thousands of years.', 137, 'superuser');
CALL insert_content_revision('Regor, also known as Gamma Velorum or Suhail al Muhlif, is the brightest star in the constellation Vela and the 32nd brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent magnitude of 1.78. Located approximately 840 light-years from Earth, Regor is actually a complex multiple star system consisting of at least six stars. The primary component is a rare Wolf-Rayet star, one of the closest to Earth, orbited by a blue giant companion. This pair forms one of the brightest examples of a Wolf-Rayet binary system. The Wolf-Rayet component is about 9 times the Sun''s mass but has already lost a significant amount of its original mass through intense stellar winds and is rapidly approaching the end of its life. The name "Regor" has an unusual modern origin—it is "Roger" spelled backward, named by the astronaut Roger Chaffee''s colleagues on the Apollo 1 mission as an unofficial designation that later gained some popularity. The star was also traditionally known as "Suhail al Muhlif" in Arabic astronomy. The Wolf-Rayet component of Regor is a highly evolved, hot star with a surface temperature of about 57,000 K, and it is ejecting its outer layers at an incredible rate of about 1,600 km/s, creating a distinctive emission spectrum. The entire system is extremely luminous, with the primary pair alone shining with approximately 170,000 times the luminosity of our Sun.

Located approximately 81 light-years from Earth, Alioth is a white subgiant star with about 2.9 times the Sun''s mass and 4.2 times its radius, with a surface temperature of approximately 9,400 K. The star is the most luminous of the seven stars that form the Big Dipper asterism, an easily recognizable pattern within Ursa Major. Alioth is notable for having an unusually strong magnetic field for a star of its type, about 100 times stronger than that of Sirius, and is classified as an Alpha2 Canum Venaticorum variable star, showing small fluctuations in brightness as it rotates due to chemical peculiarities in its atmosphere. The name "Alioth" comes from Arabic and originally referred to a "black horse," though there is some debate about the exact etymology and its connection to the star. At about 300 million years old, Alioth is a middle-aged star that has begun to evolve off the main sequence. The star has a peculiar spectrum that shows strong lines of certain metals, particularly europium and chromium, suggesting these elements are concentrated in its outer layers. As part of the Big Dipper, Alioth has been an important star for navigation and timekeeping in many cultures throughout history, and it is one of the stars used in the traditional "star hopping" technique to locate Polaris, the North Star.', 139, 'superuser');

Located approximately 143 light-years from Earth, Kaus Australis is a blue-white giant star with about 7.8 times the Sun''s mass and 6.8 times its radius, with a surface temperature of approximately 9,960 K. The star is actually a binary system, with a much fainter companion orbiting the primary star. Kaus Australis marks the southern part of the archer''s bow in the constellation Sagittarius, and its name comes from a combination of Arabic and Latin, meaning "southern bow." The star is a relatively fast rotator, completing one rotation in just over 16 hours, which gives it a slightly oblate shape. At an estimated age of about 45 million years, Kaus Australis is still relatively young but has already evolved off the main sequence due to its high mass. The star is located near the ecliptic, which means it can be occulted by the Moon and, very rarely, by planets. Kaus Australis is situated in a particularly rich part of the Milky Way and appears to be near the center of our galaxy from our perspective, though it is actually much closer to Earth than the galactic center. In ancient Arabian astronomy, Kaus Australis was part of a larger asterism called "the Ostriches," and it has played a significant role in the celestial navigation systems of many cultures.', 140, 'superuser');
CALL insert_content_revision('Spica, also known as Alpha Virginis, is the brightest star in the constellation Virgo and the 16th brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent magnitude of 1.04. Located approximately 250 light-years from Earth, Spica is actually a close binary star system consisting of two massive blue stars in a tight orbit. The primary component has about 10 times the Sun''s mass and 7 times its radius, while the secondary has about 7 times the Sun''s mass, with both having surface temperatures of approximately 22,400 K and 18,500 K respectively. The two stars orbit each other every 4 days at a distance so close that they are gravitationally distorted into egg shapes due to their mutual gravitational pull. This proximity also causes their brightness to vary slightly as they orbit. The name "Spica" comes from Latin and means "ear of wheat," referring to the sheaf of wheat that Virgo is traditionally depicted holding. Spica has been an important star in astronomy since ancient times and was used by the Greek astronomer Hipparchus to discover the precession of the equinoxes in 127 BCE. The star lies almost exactly on the ecliptic, meaning it can be occulted by the Moon and, very rarely, by planets. In many ancient agricultural societies, the heliacal rising of Spica marked the beginning of the harvest season. At approximately 12.5 million years old, the stars in the Spica system are relatively young but evolving rapidly due to their high masses, with the primary component likely to explode as a supernova within the next few million years.', 141, 'superuser');
CALL insert_content_revision('Polaris, also known as Alpha Ursae Minoris or the North Star, is the brightest star in the constellation Ursa Minor and the 48th brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent magnitude of 1.98. Located approximately 430 light-years from Earth, Polaris is actually a multiple star system, with the main component being a yellow-white supergiant about 5.4 times the Sun''s mass and 46 times its radius, with a surface temperature of approximately 6,000 K. Polaris is famous for its position less than 1 degree from the north celestial pole, making it an extremely important navigational star throughout human history. As Earth rotates, Polaris appears nearly stationary in the night sky while other stars appear to circle around it. The star is a classical Cepheid variable, pulsating in size and brightness over a period of about 4 days, though its variability has been decreasing notably over the past century, puzzling astronomers. The name "Polaris" comes from Latin meaning "pole star." Due to precession of Earth''s axis, Polaris has not always been, and will not always be, the pole star—around 3000 BCE, the pole star was Thuban (Alpha Draconis), and in about 13,000 years, it will be Vega. The Polaris system includes a close companion, Polaris Ab, discovered in 2006, which orbits the primary star every 30 years, as well as two more distant companions, Polaris B and C.

The star appears distinctly orange-red to the naked eye, and its isolated position in a relatively dim part of the sky has earned it the nickname "the Solitary One." The name "Alphard" comes from Arabic and means "the solitary one of the serpent," referring to its position as the heart of the serpent in the Hydra constellation. At an estimated age of about 420 million years, Alphard is in an advanced stage of stellar evolution, having exhausted the hydrogen in its core and now fusing helium. The star is a suspected variable, showing small, irregular changes in brightness. Alphard is moving through space at an unusually high velocity compared to nearby stars, suggesting it may have been ejected from a binary system or star cluster earlier in its life. In ancient Chinese astronomy, Alphard was known as "the Bird Star" and was associated with the vermilion bird of the south, one of the four celestial animals in Chinese constellation traditions. Despite its designation as Alpha Hydrae, it is not the most luminous star in Hydra when absolute magnitude is considered—several stars in the constellation are intrinsically brighter but appear fainter due to their greater distance from Earth.', 143, 'superuser');

The primary component is an orange-red giant with about 1.23 times the Sun''s mass and has expanded to about 31 times the Sun''s radius, with a surface temperature of approximately 4,470 K. Its companion is a yellow giant with about 1.19 times the Sun''s mass and 10 times the Sun''s radius, with a surface temperature of approximately 4,980 K. The two stars orbit each other with a period of about 619 years at an average separation of about 170 astronomical units (AU). Even a small telescope can resolve the pair, making Algieba a popular target for amateur astronomers. The name "Algieba" (or "Algeiba") comes from Arabic and means "the forehead," referring to its position in the sickle asterism that forms the head and mane of Leo, the lion. In 2009, astronomers discovered a planet orbiting the primary star, though later analysis has cast doubt on this finding. Both stars in the Algieba system are evolved stars that have exhausted the hydrogen in their cores, with the primary star being further along in its evolution. The contrasting colors of the pair—orange-red for the primary and yellow for the secondary—make Algieba one of the most beautiful double stars in the sky for telescopic observation.', 144, 'superuser');

The primary star has a very close companion with which it forms a spectroscopic binary, completing an orbit every 357 days. A third, more distant companion orbits this pair. The Hadar system is very young, with the primary star being only about 14 million years old, but due to its high mass, it has already evolved off the main sequence and will likely explode as a supernova within the next few million years. The name "Hadar" is derived from Arabic, though its exact meaning is uncertain; the alternative name "Agena" is of modern origin with unclear etymology. Hadar appears close to Alpha Centauri in the night sky, and the two stars serve as important pointer stars to the Southern Cross, one of the most recognizable asterisms in the southern sky. The system is located in one of the brightest parts of the Milky Way and is a member of the Scorpius-Centaurus Association, the nearest OB association to our Solar System. Unlike many bright stars that have been studied for centuries, detailed information about the Hadar system has only been obtained relatively recently due to its position in the southern sky, away from the major astronomical centers of the ancient world.', 145, 'superuser');

The two stars orbit each other extremely closely, completing one orbit every 3.96 days at an average separation of only about 0.08 astronomical units (AU)—less than a quarter of the distance between Mercury and the Sun. This proximity causes the stars to gravitationally distort each other into slight ellipsoidal shapes. Menkalinan is an eclipsing binary, meaning the orbital plane is aligned almost exactly with our line of sight, so each star partially eclipses the other during every orbit, causing a slight dip in brightness that can be detected with precise instruments. The name "Menkalinan" comes from Arabic and means "the shoulder of the rein-holder," referring to its position marking the right shoulder of the charioteer in the constellation Auriga. At about 570 million years old, the Menkalinan system is middle-aged, and both stars have begun to evolve off the main sequence.

Located approximately 420 light-years from Earth, Atria is an orange giant star with about 7 times the Sun''s mass and has expanded to about 130 times the Sun''s radius as it has evolved off the main sequence, with a surface temperature of approximately 4,150 K. The star''s name is simply a contraction of its Bayer designation, Alpha Trianguli Australis. Atria is located in the deep southern sky and is never visible from latitudes north of about 25 degrees north, making it unknown to many ancient northern hemisphere civilizations despite its brightness. The constellation Triangulum Australe was first defined by navigators in the late 16th century during European exploration of the southern hemisphere. At an estimated age of about 50 million years, Atria has already undergone significant evolution due to its relatively high mass. It is currently in a stable phase of core helium burning but will eventually expand further into a more luminous giant before shedding its outer layers to form a planetary nebula with a white dwarf remnant at its center. Atria is a useful navigational star for southern hemisphere observers due to its brightness and distinctive position at the apex of the small but easily recognizable triangle formed by the three brightest stars of Triangulum Australe. The star is also notable for its high velocity through space, moving at about 19 km/s relative to our Sun, which is faster than many nearby stars of similar type.', 152, 'superuser');
CALL insert_content_revision('Alhena, also known as Gamma Geminorum, is the third-brightest star in the constellation Gemini and the 56th brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent magnitude of 1.93. Located approximately 105 light-years from Earth, Alhena is actually a binary star system whose primary component is a white subgiant star with about 2.8 times the Sun''s mass and 3.3 times its radius, with a surface temperature of approximately 9,260 K. The companion is a faint, low-mass star orbiting at a distance of at least 800 astronomical units (AU), with an orbital period estimated to be at least 12,500 years. The primary star is beginning to evolve off the main sequence, having nearly exhausted the hydrogen in its core. The name "Alhena" comes from Arabic and refers to a "brand" or "mark" on a camel''s neck, though the connection to the star is not entirely clear. In the constellation Gemini, Alhena marks one of the feet of the twin Pollux. Alhena is notable for having an unusually low abundance of iron and other metals compared to our Sun, with only about 40% of the Sun''s metallicity. At about 420 million years old, the Alhena system is middle-aged. The primary star is expected to continue evolving into a true giant over the next few hundred million years before eventually shedding its outer layers to form a planetary nebula with a white dwarf remnant at its center. In ancient Chinese astronomy, Alhena was part of an asterism called "The Well," and it has been significant in the celestial navigation and timekeeping systems of various cultures throughout history.', 153, 'superuser');
CALL insert_content_revision('Peacock, also known as Alpha Pavonis, is the brightest star in the constellation Pavo (the Peacock) and the 40th brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent magnitude of 1.94. Located approximately 180 light-years from Earth, Peacock is a blue-white main-sequence star with about 5 times the Sun''s mass and 4.9 times its radius, with a surface temperature of approximately 17,600 K. The star is still in the prime of its life, fusing hydrogen in its core, though due to its high mass, it will have a shorter lifespan than our Sun. The name "Peacock" is simply derived from the constellation in which it resides. The constellation Pavo was created by Dutch navigators Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman in the late 16th century during mapping expeditions of the southern sky, and it was first published by Johann Bayer in his 1603 star atlas Uranometria. Located in the deep southern sky, Peacock never rises above the horizon for observers north of about 32 degrees north latitude, making it invisible from most of Europe and North America. At an estimated age of about 40-50 million years, Peacock is still relatively young. Despite its youth, it rotates relatively slowly for a star of its type, with a projected rotational velocity of about 16 km/s. Peacock is a useful navigational star for southern hemisphere navigators and was one of the 57 stars used in the early space program as navigational references. The star has not featured prominently in mythology largely because it was not visible to the ancient civilizations of the northern hemisphere that developed the most well-known stellar folklore.', 154, 'superuser');

Located approximately 3,900 light-years from Earth in the constellation Canis Major, VY Canis Majoris is too faint to be seen with the naked eye despite its enormous size and luminosity, with an apparent magnitude ranging from 6.5 to 9.6. The star is a highly evolved red hypergiant with an estimated mass of about 17 times that of the Sun, but has expanded to a radius that may be as large as 1,420 times the Sun''s radius—if placed at the center of our Solar System, its surface would extend beyond the orbit of Jupiter. VY Canis Majoris has a surface temperature of approximately 3,490 K and shines with the luminosity of approximately 270,000 Suns. The star is surrounded by an extensive and complex envelope of ejected material, forming one of the largest known circumstellar nebulae, which extends about 0.25 light-years from the star and contains enough material to form several new stars. VY Canis Majoris is classified as a semiregular variable star, showing irregular changes in brightness over time. At only about 8-10 million years old, VY Canis Majoris has already reached an advanced stage of stellar evolution due to its high mass and is now nearing the end of its life. The star is expected to explode as a supernova within the next 100,000 years, which will be visible from Earth even in daylight when it occurs.

Located approximately 5,100 light-years from Earth in the constellation Scutum, UY Scuti is much too faint to be seen with the naked eye, with an apparent magnitude varying between 8.29 and 10.56. The star is an enormous red supergiant with an estimated mass of about 7-10 times that of the Sun but has expanded to a radius that may be as large as 1,700 times the Sun''s radius—if placed at the center of our Solar System, its surface would extend well beyond the orbit of Jupiter, reaching nearly to Saturn. UY Scuti has a surface temperature of approximately 3,500 K and shines with the luminosity of about 340,000 Suns, though precise measurements are difficult due to interstellar extinction. The star was first cataloged in 1860 by German astronomers at the Bonn Observatory during their survey of the southern sky, but its extreme size was only recognized in 2012 following observations with the Very Large Telescope. UY Scuti is classified as a pulsating variable star of the semiregular type, with its brightness varying over a period of about 740 days. At an estimated age of only a few million years, UY Scuti has already reached an advanced stage of stellar evolution due to its high mass and is currently fusing helium in its core. The star is losing mass at a prodigious rate through powerful stellar winds, creating an extended envelope of ejected material around it.

Jupiter lacks a solid surface, transitioning from gaseous outer layers to an increasingly dense, hot interior that may contain a rocky core. The planet''s most distinctive feature is its Great Red Spot, a giant storm system larger than Earth that has persisted for at least 400 years. Jupiter''s atmosphere displays colorful cloud bands and turbulent storms created by strong winds reaching up to 620 kph (385 mph). With the strongest magnetic field in the Solar System (14 times stronger than Earth''s), Jupiter generates intense radiation belts that would be lethal to unprotected humans. The planet rotates faster than any other in our Solar System, completing one rotation in just under 10 hours despite its enormous size, creating a visible equatorial bulge.

The planet''s most distinctive feature, its rings, extend up to 282,000 kilometers from the center of the planet yet are remarkably thin—typically less than 100 meters thick. These rings consist of countless particles ranging from microscopic dust to bus-sized chunks, composed mainly of water ice with traces of rocky material. Saturn has at least 82 moons, with Titan being the largest—bigger than the planet Mercury and the only moon in our Solar System with a substantial atmosphere. Like Jupiter, Saturn lacks a solid surface, transitioning from gas to liquid to a possible rocky core as depth increases.

This extreme tilt gives Uranus the most unusual seasons in the Solar System, with each pole experiencing 42 years of continuous sunlight followed by 42 years of darkness during its 84-year orbit around the Sun. Uranus is classified as an "ice giant" rather than a gas giant, as its interior contains more water, ammonia, and methane ices than Jupiter and Saturn.

Rhea''s surface is heavily cratered and has bright, wispy features that are now known to be ice cliffs. Named after a Titan in Greek mythology who was the mother of Zeus, this icy moon has a composition of roughly 75% water ice and 25% rock. In 2008, observations suggested Rhea might have a tenuous ring system, which would make it the only moon known to have rings, though later studies could not confirm this finding. Rhea''s interior is believed to be homogeneous, consisting of ice and rock throughout without a differentiated core.', 194, 'superuser');

Discovered in 1671 by Giovanni Domenico Cassini, it is known for its dramatic two-toned appearance—one hemisphere is dark as coal (albedo 0.03-0.05) while the other is bright as snow (albedo 0.5-0.6). This stark contrast earned it the nickname "the yin-yang moon." With a diameter of 1,470 kilometers, Iapetus orbits Saturn at a greater distance than any other major moon, about 3.56 million kilometers, taking 79 days to complete one orbit. Another distinctive feature is a massive equatorial ridge that rises up to 20 kilometers high, giving the moon a walnut-like appearance.

Despite its small size (504 kilometers in diameter), it is one of the most scientifically interesting bodies in the Solar System. Enceladus has a bright, highly reflective surface composed almost entirely of fresh, clean ice, making it one of the most reflective objects in the Solar System. Its most remarkable feature is the geologically active south polar region, where over 100 geysers continuously eject plumes of water vapor, ice particles, and organic compounds from beneath the icy crust. These plumes feed Saturn''s E ring and provide compelling evidence for a global subsurface saltwater ocean. The Cassini spacecraft detected complex organic compounds in these plumes, making Enceladus one of the prime candidates for potential extraterrestrial life in our Solar System.', 198, 'superuser');

With a diameter of just 396 kilometers, this icy satellite is dominated by an enormous impact crater called Herschel, which measures 139 kilometers across—nearly one-third of the moon''s own diameter. This distinctive feature gives Mimas an uncanny resemblance to the Death Star from Star Wars. Named after a giant in Greek mythology who was slain by Hercules, Mimas has a heavily cratered surface and orbits Saturn at a distance of about 185,500 kilometers. Despite its small size, Mimas creates a 4,800-kilometer-wide gap in Saturn''s rings known as the Cassini Division.

Named after a Titan in Greek mythology, Hyperion is unique among Saturn''s large moons for its chaotic rotation—it tumbles unpredictably rather than being tidally locked like most moons. Composed primarily of water ice with a small amount of rock, it has an unusually low density and high porosity, suggesting a rubble-pile structure. Hyperion''s odd appearance and rotation may result from a catastrophic impact that blasted away much of its mass, leaving behind the strange object we see today.', 200, 'superuser');

Unlike most of Saturn''s moons, Phoebe orbits in a retrograde direction (opposite to Saturn''s rotation) at a great distance from the planet—about 12.9 million kilometers. With a diameter of about 213 kilometers, it has an irregular shape and a very dark surface, reflecting only about 6% of the sunlight that hits it. Named after a Titaness in Greek mythology, Phoebe is believed to be a captured Kuiper Belt object rather than having formed alongside Saturn. The Cassini spacecraft''s flyby in 2004 revealed a heavily cratered surface and evidence that Phoebe is composed of ice, rock, and carbon compounds.

CALL insert_content_revision('Janus is a small inner moon of Saturn, discovered in 1966 by French astronomer Audouin Dollfus. What makes Janus truly remarkable is its unique orbital relationship with another Saturnian moon, Epimetheus—they share nearly identical orbits just a few kilometers apart. Every four years, the inner moon catches up to the outer one, and instead of colliding, they gravitationally interact, swapping orbits in a cosmic dance found nowhere else in the Solar System. With dimensions of approximately 203 × 185 × 153 kilometers, Janus has an irregular shape and a heavily cratered surface. Named after the two-faced Roman god of transitions, this moon orbits Saturn at a distance of about 151,500 kilometers, just outside the main ring system, and is likely a "rubble pile" consisting of numerous pieces held together by gravity rather than a solid body.', 202, 'superuser');
CALL insert_content_revision('Epimetheus is a small inner moon of Saturn, co-discovered independently by several teams in 1966, though its unique nature wasn''t understood until 1978. What makes Epimetheus extraordinary is its shared orbit with Saturn''s moon Janus—they occupy nearly the same orbit just a few kilometers apart. Every four years, they perform an orbital swap without colliding, a unique phenomenon in the Solar System. With dimensions of approximately 130 × 114 × 106 kilometers, Epimetheus has an irregular shape and a heavily cratered surface. Named after the Greek Titan who was the brother of Prometheus and husband of Pandora, this moon orbits Saturn at a distance of about 151,400 kilometers, just outside the main ring system.

Named after the Titan in Greek mythology who gave fire to humanity, Prometheus acts as a "shepherd moon" for Saturn''s F ring, helping to maintain its narrow structure through gravitational interactions. Its orbit brings it close enough to the F ring to draw material from it, creating streamer-channels in the ring every 14.7 hours.

Named after the first woman in Greek mythology who unwittingly released all evils into the world, Pandora serves as an outer "shepherd moon" for Saturn''s F ring, helping to confine the ring particles through gravitational interactions. Its surface is heavily cratered, suggesting it has undergone little geological evolution since its formation.

Named after the Titan in Greek mythology who held up the heavens, Atlas orbits Saturn at a distance of about 137,700 kilometers—just 880 kilometers outside the outer edge of Saturn''s A ring—making it the closest satellite to the main rings. This moon acts as a ring shepherd, helping to maintain the sharp edge of the A ring through gravitational interactions. The equatorial ridge likely formed from ring particles that Atlas has accumulated over time due to its position near the rings. Images from the Cassini mission show a smooth surface, suggesting the moon is covered in a layer of fine dust particles.', 206, 'superuser');

Named after the Greek god of shepherds, Pan orbits within the Encke Gap, a 325-kilometer wide division in Saturn''s A ring. As a ring shepherd moon, it maintains the gap through gravitational interactions, clearing its orbital path of ring particles. The equatorial ridge is thought to have formed from ring material that Pan has accumulated over time.

Named after the daughter of the magician Prospero in Shakespeare''s "The Tempest," its surface features enormous cliff faces or "coronae" that may be up to 20 kilometers high—some of the tallest known cliffs in the Solar System. The bizarre patchwork terrain includes grooved regions, ridges, and different types of cratered areas abruptly juxtaposed.

Discovered in 1846 by William Lassell just days after Neptune itself was found, Triton has a diameter of approximately 2,710 kilometers, making it the seventh-largest moon in the Solar System. Its retrograde orbit suggests it was captured by Neptune''s gravity rather than forming alongside the planet. Triton''s surface is remarkably young, with few impact craters, and is composed primarily of nitrogen ice with traces of methane and carbon dioxide. It has an extremely thin nitrogen atmosphere and is one of the coldest objects in the Solar System at -235°C. Voyager 2''s 1989 flyby revealed active geysers erupting nitrogen gas and dust particles several kilometers into space, making Triton one of only four bodies in the Solar System (along with Earth, Jupiter''s Io, and Saturn''s Enceladus) known to be volcanically active.

Named after the sea nymphs of Greek mythology, Nereid takes 360 days to complete one orbit. Its highly eccentric path suggests it may be a captured object or was significantly disturbed when Neptune captured Triton. Very little is known about Nereid''s surface characteristics because the only spacecraft to visit the Neptunian system, Voyager 2, passed at a great distance from it in 1989.

Named after the Roman goddess of home and hearth, Vesta has a unique composition among large asteroids—it appears to be a differentiated body with a dense iron-nickel core, olivine-rich mantle, and basaltic crust, similar to terrestrial planets. Its surface features a massive impact basin at the south pole called Rheasilvia, measuring about 500 kilometers across and 19 kilometers deep. This impact ejected about 1% of Vesta''s mass, creating a family of smaller asteroids and meteorites that have reached Earth.

Despite its tremendous distance, TON 618 is bright enough to be visible in large amateur telescopes. The black hole is so large that if placed in our Solar System, its event horizon would extend far beyond the orbit of Pluto. TON 618 provides astronomers with valuable insights into the formation of supermassive black holes in the early universe and the physics of extreme gravitational environments.', 265, 'superuser');
CALL insert_content_revision('The OJ 287 Binary Black Hole system is one of the largest known black hole systems in the universe, located approximately 3.5 billion light-years from Earth. It consists of two supermassive black holes in close orbit around each other: a primary black hole with a mass of about 18 billion solar masses, and a secondary black hole with a mass of about 150 million solar masses. The system is known for its regular optical outbursts occurring approximately every 12 years, as the smaller black hole passes through the accretion disk surrounding the primary black hole, causing intense flares that can be observed from Earth. OJ 287 is one of the strongest candidates for a binary supermassive black hole system and serves as an important laboratory for testing general relativity in strong gravitational fields. The precise timing of these outbursts has allowed astronomers to measure the spin of the primary black hole and to confirm predictions of Einstein''s theory with remarkable precision.', 266, 'superuser');
CALL insert_content_revision('The Andromeda Black Hole, officially designated as M31*, is a supermassive black hole at the center of the Andromeda Galaxy, the nearest major galaxy to our Milky Way at a distance of about 2.5 million light-years. The black hole has an estimated mass of 100-230 million solar masses, significantly smaller than the Milky Way''s central black hole Sagittarius A*, despite Andromeda being a larger galaxy overall. M31* is currently in a dormant state with minimal accretion activity, making it challenging to observe directly. Evidence for its existence comes primarily from the motions of stars in the galaxy''s central region. As the Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way are on a collision course, set to merge in about 4.5 billion years, the two supermassive black holes will eventually form a binary system before merging into a single, more massive black hole. This future merger will provide astronomers billions of years from now with a relatively nearby example of a phenomenon that was common in the early universe.', 267, 'superuser');

CALL insert_content_revision('The Hubble Space Telescope is a space telescope launched into low Earth orbit in 1990 and remains in operation. It was not the first space telescope, but it is one of the largest and most versatile, renowned both as a vital research tool and as a public relations boon for astronomy. The Hubble telescope is named after astronomer Edwin Hubble and is one of NASA''s Great Observatories. Hubble''s orbit outside the distortion of Earth''s atmosphere allows it to capture extremely high-resolution images with substantially lower background light than ground-based telescopes. It has recorded some of the most detailed visible light images, allowing a deep view into space and time, and has fundamentally changed our understanding of the cosmos.', 269, 'superuser');

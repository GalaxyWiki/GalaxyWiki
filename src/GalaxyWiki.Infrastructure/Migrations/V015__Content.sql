The galaxy is characterized by its prominent and well-defined spiral arms, which display bright H II regions and young star clusters, indicating active star formation throughout the disk. M101 has an asymmetric appearance, with one arm being more prominent than others, likely due to past gravitational interactions with companion galaxies. The Pinwheel Galaxy has been the site of several observed supernovae, including SN 2011fe, one of the closest Type Ia supernovae observed in recent decades. Its face-on orientation and relative proximity make it an excellent laboratory for studying spiral structure and star formation processes.', 21, 'superuser');
CALL insert_content_revision('The Cartwheel Galaxy is a lenticular ring galaxy located approximately 500 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Sculptor. Its distinctive appearance resembles a wagon wheel, with a bright central hub surrounded by a ring of young stars about 150,000 light-years in diameter. This unusual structure is the result of a high-speed collision with a smaller galaxy that passed through the Cartwheel''s center about 200-300 million years ago, creating a shock wave that swept gas outward and triggered star formation in the ring. The galaxy is still recovering from this collision, with the ring continuing to expand at about 200,000 miles per hour. Between the central nucleus and the outer ring lies a region containing significant amounts of gas but relatively few stars. The Cartwheel Galaxy is part of a group of galaxies and provides astronomers with a rare opportunity to observe galaxy evolution following a direct collision.', 22, 'superuser');

It derives its name from its elongated, cigar-like shape when viewed from Earth. M82 is undergoing an exceptional rate of star formation, about 10 times higher than in the Milky Way, triggered by a close encounter with the nearby galaxy M81 about 100-300 million years ago. This intense activity has resulted in superheated gas being expelled from the galaxy''s center at speeds of up to 1,000 kilometers per second, creating prominent filaments visible in X-ray and radio observations. Despite being relatively small at about 37,000 light-years across, M82 shines five times brighter than the entire Milky Way due to its starburst activity.

It gets its nickname from the distinctive dark band of absorbing dust in front of the galaxy''s bright nucleus, giving it the appearance of a black eye. The galaxy spans about 65,000 light-years in diameter and contains approximately 100 billion stars. M64 has an unusual feature: the gas in the outer regions rotates in the opposite direction from the gas and stars in the inner regions. This counter-rotating structure is likely the result of a merger with a smaller satellite galaxy that occurred over a billion years ago. The collision zone between these counter-rotating regions is an area of active star formation.

It gets its distinctive tadpole-like appearance from a long ''tail'' of stars, gas, and dust extending about 280,000 light-years from its main body. This tail was formed approximately 100 million years ago when a smaller galaxy passed through the Tadpole, disrupting its structure through gravitational forces. The intruder galaxy, now visible as a bright blue clump, triggered intense star formation in both the main galaxy and the tail. The tail region contains numerous young star clusters that formed in the wake of the collision. Despite its disturbed appearance, the Tadpole Galaxy is expected to eventually settle back into a normal spiral shape after several hundred million years.

The ring, which is about 70,000 light-years in diameter, contains many massive, newly formed stars. The unusual structure of Hoag''s Object has puzzled astronomers for decades, as most ring galaxies form through collisions, but Hoag''s Object shows no signs of a recent merger. Theories for its formation include a past collision that left no trace, an internal bar structure that dissolved over time, or accretion of material from a companion galaxy. Intriguingly, another ring galaxy can be seen through the gap between Hoag''s ring and core, making it one of the most unusual galactic structures known.', 28, 'superuser');
CALL insert_content_revision('The Antennae Galaxies (NGC 4038/NGC 4039) are a pair of interacting galaxies located approximately 45-65 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Corvus. Named for their resemblance to insect antennae, they are one of the nearest and youngest examples of colliding galaxies. The collision began about 600 million years ago and has triggered extensive star formation, with over 1,000 bright star clusters having formed in the merger. Long tidal tails of stars, gas, and dust extend from both galaxies, spanning over 350,000 light-years. These tails were formed as gravitational forces drew out material from the original galaxies during their close encounters. The Antennae are rich in molecular hydrogen gas, providing ideal conditions for ongoing star formation. In about 400 million years, they will complete their merger to form a single elliptical galaxy.

These tails, stretching about 280,000 light-years, were formed by tidal forces as the two galaxies began colliding about 160 million years ago. Computer simulations suggest the Mice are on their second close encounter, having already passed through each other once, and will eventually merge into a single elliptical galaxy after several more passes. The collision has triggered significant star formation in both galaxies, particularly at their centers and where their disks overlap.

NGC 2207, the larger of the two, is in the process of tidally stripping material from the smaller IC 2163. This ongoing interaction, which began about 40 million years ago, has created distinctive features in both galaxies: NGC 2207''s spiral arms have been enhanced and distorted, while IC 2163 has developed an eye-shaped tidal tail on its far side. Computer simulations suggest the smaller galaxy completed a close pass behind NGC 2207 and is now moving away, but the galaxies remain gravitationally bound and will eventually merge. The collision has triggered significant star formation throughout both galaxies. Remarkably, three supernovae have been observed in NGC 2207 within the past 25 years (SN 1975A, SN 1999ec, and SN 2003H), making this system particularly valuable for studying how galaxy interactions affect stellar evolution.', 34, 'superuser');

It is the brightest spiral galaxy in the Coma Cluster, one of the densest known galaxy clusters in the universe containing thousands of galaxies. Despite residing in this crowded environment, NGC 4921 maintains a well-defined spiral structure with smooth arms. The galaxy is classified as an anemic spiral due to its relatively low rate of star formation and reduced gas content compared to similar galaxies in less dense environments. This condition likely results from ram pressure stripping as the galaxy moves through the hot gas pervading the Coma Cluster. NGC 4921 spans about 125,000 light-years in diameter and features a prominent bar through its center.

CALL insert_content_revision('The Backward Galaxy (NGC 4622) is a spiral galaxy located approximately 111 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Centaurus. It earned its nickname due to its unusual rotation pattern: unlike most spiral galaxies, NGC 4622 appears to be rotating in the opposite direction to what its spiral arms suggest. The galaxy has two prominent outer arms that point clockwise and one inner arm that points counterclockwise, but detailed studies indicate it rotates counterclockwise—against the winding direction of its outer arms. This rare ''leading arm'' structure challenges standard models of galaxy formation and evolution. NGC 4622 spans about 80,000 light-years in diameter and likely acquired its unusual structure through a past merger or interaction with another galaxy, though no obvious companion is currently visible.

It earned its nickname due to the high frequency of supernovae observed within it—ten recorded since 1917, the most in any galaxy in the past century. This exceptional supernova production rate, about one every decade, is roughly 10 times higher than in a typical galaxy. NGC 6946 spans about 40,000 light-years in diameter and is oriented at an angle of about 30 degrees from our line of sight. The galaxy has a small, bright nucleus, multiple spiral arms, and is undergoing vigorous star formation throughout its disk.

It is notable for being one of the largest known spiral galaxies, with its spiral arms spanning approximately 522,000 light-years from tip to tip—about five times the size of the Milky Way. This enormous size is likely the result of an ongoing interaction with the smaller lenticular galaxy IC 4970, which can be seen near NGC 6872''s central bar. The collision has triggered star formation along the stretched spiral arms, particularly in the northern arm where clusters of young, blue stars are prominent. Computer simulations suggest the interaction began about 130 million years ago when IC 4970 passed through NGC 6872''s disk. The Condor Galaxy continues to evolve due to these tidal forces, providing astronomers with an excellent laboratory for studying galaxy interactions and their effects on star formation.', 43, 'superuser');

Discovered in 1986 by David Malin, it is one of the largest known spiral galaxies, with a diameter of about 650,000 light-years—more than six times larger than the Milky Way. Despite its enormous size, Malin 1 remained undetected until relatively recently because its stars are spread so thinly that the galaxy''s overall brightness is extremely low. The galaxy has a small, bright central region surrounded by a vast, diffuse disk of stars and gas. Malin 1 contains enough gas to form stars for trillions of years but does so at a very slow rate. Its unusual properties challenge conventional theories of galaxy formation and evolution, suggesting that enormous disk galaxies can form and survive without developing the dense stellar populations typical of more familiar spiral galaxies.', 44, 'superuser');

The galaxy is characterized by its prominent and well-defined spiral arms, which display bright H II regions and young star clusters, indicating active star formation throughout the disk. M101 has an asymmetric appearance, with one arm being more prominent than others, likely due to past gravitational interactions with companion galaxies. The Pinwheel Galaxy has been the site of several observed supernovae, including SN 2011fe, one of the closest Type Ia supernovae observed in recent decades. Its face-on orientation and relative proximity make it an excellent laboratory for studying spiral structure and star formation processes.', 21, 'superuser');
CALL insert_content_revision('The Cartwheel Galaxy is a lenticular ring galaxy located approximately 500 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Sculptor. Its distinctive appearance resembles a wagon wheel, with a bright central hub surrounded by a ring of young stars about 150,000 light-years in diameter. This unusual structure is the result of a high-speed collision with a smaller galaxy that passed through the Cartwheel''s center about 200-300 million years ago, creating a shock wave that swept gas outward and triggered star formation in the ring. The galaxy is still recovering from this collision, with the ring continuing to expand at about 200,000 miles per hour. Between the central nucleus and the outer ring lies a region containing significant amounts of gas but relatively few stars. The Cartwheel Galaxy is part of a group of galaxies and provides astronomers with a rare opportunity to observe galaxy evolution following a direct collision.', 22, 'superuser');

It derives its name from its elongated, cigar-like shape when viewed from Earth. M82 is undergoing an exceptional rate of star formation, about 10 times higher than in the Milky Way, triggered by a close encounter with the nearby galaxy M81 about 100-300 million years ago. This intense activity has resulted in superheated gas being expelled from the galaxy''s center at speeds of up to 1,000 kilometers per second, creating prominent filaments visible in X-ray and radio observations. Despite being relatively small at about 37,000 light-years across, M82 shines five times brighter than the entire Milky Way due to its starburst activity.

It gets its nickname from the distinctive dark band of absorbing dust in front of the galaxy''s bright nucleus, giving it the appearance of a black eye. The galaxy spans about 65,000 light-years in diameter and contains approximately 100 billion stars. M64 has an unusual feature: the gas in the outer regions rotates in the opposite direction from the gas and stars in the inner regions. This counter-rotating structure is likely the result of a merger with a smaller satellite galaxy that occurred over a billion years ago. The collision zone between these counter-rotating regions is an area of active star formation.

It gets its distinctive tadpole-like appearance from a long ''tail'' of stars, gas, and dust extending about 280,000 light-years from its main body. This tail was formed approximately 100 million years ago when a smaller galaxy passed through the Tadpole, disrupting its structure through gravitational forces. The intruder galaxy, now visible as a bright blue clump, triggered intense star formation in both the main galaxy and the tail. The tail region contains numerous young star clusters that formed in the wake of the collision. Despite its disturbed appearance, the Tadpole Galaxy is expected to eventually settle back into a normal spiral shape after several hundred million years.

The ring, which is about 70,000 light-years in diameter, contains many massive, newly formed stars. The unusual structure of Hoag''s Object has puzzled astronomers for decades, as most ring galaxies form through collisions, but Hoag''s Object shows no signs of a recent merger. Theories for its formation include a past collision that left no trace, an internal bar structure that dissolved over time, or accretion of material from a companion galaxy. Intriguingly, another ring galaxy can be seen through the gap between Hoag''s ring and core, making it one of the most unusual galactic structures known.', 28, 'superuser');
CALL insert_content_revision('The Antennae Galaxies (NGC 4038/NGC 4039) are a pair of interacting galaxies located approximately 45-65 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Corvus. Named for their resemblance to insect antennae, they are one of the nearest and youngest examples of colliding galaxies. The collision began about 600 million years ago and has triggered extensive star formation, with over 1,000 bright star clusters having formed in the merger. Long tidal tails of stars, gas, and dust extend from both galaxies, spanning over 350,000 light-years. These tails were formed as gravitational forces drew out material from the original galaxies during their close encounters. The Antennae are rich in molecular hydrogen gas, providing ideal conditions for ongoing star formation. In about 400 million years, they will complete their merger to form a single elliptical galaxy.

These tails, stretching about 280,000 light-years, were formed by tidal forces as the two galaxies began colliding about 160 million years ago. Computer simulations suggest the Mice are on their second close encounter, having already passed through each other once, and will eventually merge into a single elliptical galaxy after several more passes. The collision has triggered significant star formation in both galaxies, particularly at their centers and where their disks overlap.

NGC 2207, the larger of the two, is in the process of tidally stripping material from the smaller IC 2163. This ongoing interaction, which began about 40 million years ago, has created distinctive features in both galaxies: NGC 2207''s spiral arms have been enhanced and distorted, while IC 2163 has developed an eye-shaped tidal tail on its far side. Computer simulations suggest the smaller galaxy completed a close pass behind NGC 2207 and is now moving away, but the galaxies remain gravitationally bound and will eventually merge. The collision has triggered significant star formation throughout both galaxies. Remarkably, three supernovae have been observed in NGC 2207 within the past 25 years (SN 1975A, SN 1999ec, and SN 2003H), making this system particularly valuable for studying how galaxy interactions affect stellar evolution.', 34, 'superuser');

It is the brightest spiral galaxy in the Coma Cluster, one of the densest known galaxy clusters in the universe containing thousands of galaxies. Despite residing in this crowded environment, NGC 4921 maintains a well-defined spiral structure with smooth arms. The galaxy is classified as an anemic spiral due to its relatively low rate of star formation and reduced gas content compared to similar galaxies in less dense environments. This condition likely results from ram pressure stripping as the galaxy moves through the hot gas pervading the Coma Cluster. NGC 4921 spans about 125,000 light-years in diameter and features a prominent bar through its center.

CALL insert_content_revision('The Backward Galaxy (NGC 4622) is a spiral galaxy located approximately 111 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Centaurus. It earned its nickname due to its unusual rotation pattern: unlike most spiral galaxies, NGC 4622 appears to be rotating in the opposite direction to what its spiral arms suggest. The galaxy has two prominent outer arms that point clockwise and one inner arm that points counterclockwise, but detailed studies indicate it rotates counterclockwise—against the winding direction of its outer arms. This rare ''leading arm'' structure challenges standard models of galaxy formation and evolution. NGC 4622 spans about 80,000 light-years in diameter and likely acquired its unusual structure through a past merger or interaction with another galaxy, though no obvious companion is currently visible.

It earned its nickname due to the high frequency of supernovae observed within it—ten recorded since 1917, the most in any galaxy in the past century. This exceptional supernova production rate, about one every decade, is roughly 10 times higher than in a typical galaxy. NGC 6946 spans about 40,000 light-years in diameter and is oriented at an angle of about 30 degrees from our line of sight. The galaxy has a small, bright nucleus, multiple spiral arms, and is undergoing vigorous star formation throughout its disk.

It is notable for being one of the largest known spiral galaxies, with its spiral arms spanning approximately 522,000 light-years from tip to tip—about five times the size of the Milky Way. This enormous size is likely the result of an ongoing interaction with the smaller lenticular galaxy IC 4970, which can be seen near NGC 6872''s central bar. The collision has triggered star formation along the stretched spiral arms, particularly in the northern arm where clusters of young, blue stars are prominent. Computer simulations suggest the interaction began about 130 million years ago when IC 4970 passed through NGC 6872''s disk. The Condor Galaxy continues to evolve due to these tidal forces, providing astronomers with an excellent laboratory for studying galaxy interactions and their effects on star formation.', 43, 'superuser');

Discovered in 1986 by David Malin, it is one of the largest known spiral galaxies, with a diameter of about 650,000 light-years—more than six times larger than the Milky Way. Despite its enormous size, Malin 1 remained undetected until relatively recently because its stars are spread so thinly that the galaxy''s overall brightness is extremely low. The galaxy has a small, bright central region surrounded by a vast, diffuse disk of stars and gas. Malin 1 contains enough gas to form stars for trillions of years but does so at a very slow rate. Its unusual properties challenge conventional theories of galaxy formation and evolution, suggesting that enormous disk galaxies can form and survive without developing the dense stellar populations typical of more familiar spiral galaxies.', 44, 'superuser');

Adhara is estimated to be about 23 million years old and is already in an advanced stage of its evolution due to its high mass. The name "Adhara" comes from Arabic and means "virgins," possibly referring to a group of stars in this region of the sky. In ancient navigation, Adhara was an important star for sailors, particularly in the southern hemisphere, due to its brightness and position.', 130, 'superuser');
CALL insert_content_revision('Shaula, also known as Lambda Scorpii, is the second-brightest star in the constellation Scorpius and the 25th brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent magnitude of 1.62. Located approximately 570 light-years from Earth, Shaula is actually a multiple star system consisting of at least three components. The primary star is a hot, blue-white giant about 14 times the Sun''s mass and 6 times its radius, with a surface temperature of approximately 25,000 K. It is classified as a Beta Cephei variable star, showing small variations in brightness over periods of about 5 hours due to pulsations in its outer layers. Shaula has a close companion that orbits it every 6 days, and a more distant third star completes the system. The name "Shaula" comes from Arabic and means "the raised tail," referring to its position at the end of the Scorpion''s tail in the constellation Scorpius. At only about 10-16 million years old, Shaula is a relatively young star that will likely end its life in a spectacular supernova explosion. Along with the star Lesath (Upsilon Scorpii), Shaula forms an asterism known as "the Sting" at the tip of the Scorpion''s tail.', 131, 'superuser');
CALL insert_content_revision('Castor, also known as Alpha Geminorum, is the second-brightest star in the constellation Gemini and the 23rd brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent magnitude of 1.58. Located approximately 51 light-years from Earth, Castor is a remarkable multiple star system consisting of six stars organized into three binary pairs. To the naked eye, Castor appears as a single star, but even a small telescope can resolve it into two components, Castor A and B, which are both spectroscopic binaries containing two stars each. A third, more distant component, Castor C (also known as YY Geminorum), is itself a binary system of two red dwarf stars that regularly eclipse each other. The primary stars in the system, Castor A and B, are both hot, blue-white main-sequence stars with masses about 2.4 and 1.9 times that of the Sun, respectively, while the Castor C pair consists of much cooler and less massive red dwarfs. The entire system orbits with extremely long periods—the A and B components take about 467 years to orbit each other, while C orbits the AB pair with a period of several thousand years. The name "Castor" comes from Greek mythology, where Castor was one of the twin sons of Zeus (the other being Pollux, represented by the neighboring star Beta Geminorum). Castor has been closely studied for centuries and provides valuable insights into stellar evolution in multiple star systems.', 132, 'superuser');
CALL insert_content_revision('Gacrux, also known as Gamma Crucis, is the third-brightest star in the constellation Crux (the Southern Cross) and the 26th brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent magnitude of 1.63. Located approximately 88 light-years from Earth, Gacrux is a red giant star with about 1.5 times the Sun''s mass but has expanded to about 84 times the Sun''s radius as it has evolved off the main sequence, with a surface temperature of approximately 3,600 K. The star''s distinctive reddish appearance contrasts noticeably with the blue-white color of the other bright stars in the Southern Cross, making it easy to identify. Gacrux is actually a multiple star system, with a fainter companion star orbiting at a significant distance. At an estimated age of about 100-200 million years, Gacrux is in an advanced stage of stellar evolution and has already exhausted the hydrogen in its core. The name "Gacrux" is a modern contraction of "Gamma Crucis," combining the Greek letter designation with the constellation name. As part of the Southern Cross, one of the most recognizable asterisms in the southern hemisphere, Gacrux appears on the flags of several countries, including Australia, Brazil, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and Samoa. Due to its position near the top of the cross, it is sometimes referred to as the "head" of the Southern Cross.', 133, 'superuser');
CALL insert_content_revision('Bellatrix, also known as Gamma Orionis, is the third-brightest star in the constellation Orion and the 27th brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent magnitude of 1.64. Located approximately 250 light-years from Earth, Bellatrix is a massive blue-white giant star with about 8.6 times the Sun''s mass and 5.8 times its radius, with a surface temperature of approximately 22,000 K. Unlike many bright stars, Bellatrix is a single star rather than a multiple system. The star rotates relatively rapidly, completing one rotation in about 5 days, which is faster than many giants of its type. At an estimated age of 20 million years, Bellatrix is already in an advanced stage of evolution due to its high mass. The name "Bellatrix" comes from Latin and means "female warrior" or "amazon star," making it one of the few prominent stars with a feminine name. In the constellation Orion, Bellatrix marks the left shoulder of the hunter (or right shoulder as seen from Earth) and is sometimes called the "Amazon Star." In Harry Potter lore, the name gained additional recognition as the name of a character. In navigation, Bellatrix has been important historically due to its brightness and distinctive position in one of the most recognizable constellations in the night sky.', 134, 'superuser');

Located approximately 134 light-years from Earth, Elnath is a blue-white giant star with about 4.5 times the Sun''s mass and 4.2 times its radius, with a surface temperature of approximately 13,800 K. The star occupies a unique position in the night sky, as it was historically considered to be part of both the Taurus and Auriga constellations, marking the northern horn of the bull and the southern foot of the charioteer, respectively. Modern constellation boundaries, however, place it officially in Taurus. The name "Elnath" (or "El Nath") comes from Arabic and means "the butting one," referring to its position at the tip of one of the bull''s horns. At an estimated age of about 100 million years, Elnath is still relatively young and will eventually evolve into a much larger red giant before ending its life as a massive white dwarf. Despite its brightness, Elnath has received less attention than many other bright stars in scientific research and cultural references, possibly due to its somewhat isolated position away from major asterisms or notable deep sky objects.', 135, 'superuser');

Located approximately 111 light-years from Earth, Miaplacidus is a white subgiant star with about 3.5 times the Sun''s mass and 6.8 times its radius, with a surface temperature of approximately 8,900 K. The star is in a transitional evolutionary phase, having recently exhausted the hydrogen in its core and begun to expand as it moves off the main sequence. Miaplacidus is a relatively fast rotator, completing one rotation in about 1.5 days, which contributes to its slight equatorial bulge. The name "Miaplacidus" has an unusual origin, derived from Arabic and Latin elements meaning "the placid waters," though there is some scholarly debate about the exact etymology. Located in the southern sky, Miaplacidus is not visible to observers in the northern mid-latitudes and higher, making it a significant navigation star primarily for southern hemisphere sailors and travelers. The star was historically part of the larger constellation Argo Navis (the ship Argo), which was later divided into the modern constellations Carina (the keel), Puppis (the stern), and Vela (the sails). At about 260 million years old, Miaplacidus is in its middle age and will eventually evolve into a red giant before ending its life as a white dwarf.', 136, 'superuser');

Located approximately 2,000 light-years from Earth, Alnilam is a massive blue-white supergiant star with about 40 times the Sun''s mass and 42 times its radius, with a surface temperature of approximately 27,000 K. The star is one of the most luminous stars known, shining with a luminosity roughly 375,000 times that of the Sun. If placed at a distance of 10 parsecs (the standard distance for absolute magnitude), Alnilam would outshine Venus in our sky. The name "Alnilam" comes from Arabic and means "string of pearls," referring to its position in Orion''s Belt alongside the stars Alnitak and Mintaka. At only about 5-10 million years old, Alnilam is a very young star, but due to its enormous mass, it has already evolved into the supergiant phase and will likely explode as a supernova within the next million years. The star is surrounded by a molecular cloud, NGC 1990, which it illuminates, creating a reflection nebula. Alnilam is losing mass rapidly through stellar winds, shedding material at a rate about 20 million times greater than the Sun''s solar wind. As part of Orion''s Belt, one of the most recognizable asterisms in the night sky, Alnilam has been significant in the mythology and celestial navigation of cultures worldwide for thousands of years.', 137, 'superuser');
CALL insert_content_revision('Regor, also known as Gamma Velorum or Suhail al Muhlif, is the brightest star in the constellation Vela and the 32nd brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent magnitude of 1.78. Located approximately 840 light-years from Earth, Regor is actually a complex multiple star system consisting of at least six stars. The primary component is a rare Wolf-Rayet star, one of the closest to Earth, orbited by a blue giant companion. This pair forms one of the brightest examples of a Wolf-Rayet binary system. The Wolf-Rayet component is about 9 times the Sun''s mass but has already lost a significant amount of its original mass through intense stellar winds and is rapidly approaching the end of its life. The name "Regor" has an unusual modern origin—it is "Roger" spelled backward, named by the astronaut Roger Chaffee''s colleagues on the Apollo 1 mission as an unofficial designation that later gained some popularity. The star was also traditionally known as "Suhail al Muhlif" in Arabic astronomy. The Wolf-Rayet component of Regor is a highly evolved, hot star with a surface temperature of about 57,000 K, and it is ejecting its outer layers at an incredible rate of about 1,600 km/s, creating a distinctive emission spectrum. The entire system is extremely luminous, with the primary pair alone shining with approximately 170,000 times the luminosity of our Sun. As a Wolf-Rayet star, the primary component of Regor is expected to explode as a supernova in the relatively near astronomical future.', 138, 'superuser');

Located approximately 81 light-years from Earth, Alioth is a white subgiant star with about 2.9 times the Sun''s mass and 4.2 times its radius, with a surface temperature of approximately 9,400 K. The star is the most luminous of the seven stars that form the Big Dipper asterism, an easily recognizable pattern within Ursa Major. Alioth is notable for having an unusually strong magnetic field for a star of its type, about 100 times stronger than that of Sirius, and is classified as an Alpha2 Canum Venaticorum variable star, showing small fluctuations in brightness as it rotates due to chemical peculiarities in its atmosphere. The name "Alioth" comes from Arabic and originally referred to a "black horse," though there is some debate about the exact etymology and its connection to the star. At about 300 million years old, Alioth is a middle-aged star that has begun to evolve off the main sequence. The star has a peculiar spectrum that shows strong lines of certain metals, particularly europium and chromium, suggesting these elements are concentrated in its outer layers. As part of the Big Dipper, Alioth has been an important star for navigation and timekeeping in many cultures throughout history, and it is one of the stars used in the traditional "star hopping" technique to locate Polaris, the North Star.', 139, 'superuser');
CALL insert_content_revision('Kaus Australis, also known as Epsilon Sagittarii, is the brightest star in the constellation Sagittarius and the 36th brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent magnitude of 1.85. Located approximately 143 light-years from Earth, Kaus Australis is a blue-white giant star with about 7.8 times the Sun''s mass and 6.8 times its radius, with a surface temperature of approximately 9,960 K. The star is actually a binary system, with a much fainter companion orbiting the primary star. Kaus Australis marks the southern part of the archer''s bow in the constellation Sagittarius, and its name comes from a combination of Arabic and Latin, meaning "southern bow." The star is a relatively fast rotator, completing one rotation in just over 16 hours, which gives it a slightly oblate shape. At an estimated age of about 45 million years, Kaus Australis is still relatively young but has already evolved off the main sequence due to its high mass. The star is located near the ecliptic, which means it can be occulted by the Moon and, very rarely, by planets. Kaus Australis is situated in a particularly rich part of the Milky Way and appears to be near the center of our galaxy from our perspective, though it is actually much closer to Earth than the galactic center. In ancient Arabian astronomy, Kaus Australis was part of a larger asterism called "the Ostriches," and it has played a significant role in the celestial navigation systems of many cultures.', 140, 'superuser');
CALL insert_content_revision('Spica, also known as Alpha Virginis, is the brightest star in the constellation Virgo and the 16th brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent magnitude of 1.04. Located approximately 250 light-years from Earth, Spica is actually a close binary star system consisting of two massive blue stars in a tight orbit. The primary component has about 10 times the Sun''s mass and 7 times its radius, while the secondary has about 7 times the Sun''s mass, with both having surface temperatures of approximately 22,400 K and 18,500 K respectively. The two stars orbit each other every 4 days at a distance so close that they are gravitationally distorted into egg shapes due to their mutual gravitational pull. This proximity also causes their brightness to vary slightly as they orbit. The name "Spica" comes from Latin and means "ear of wheat," referring to the sheaf of wheat that Virgo is traditionally depicted holding. Spica has been an important star in astronomy since ancient times and was used by the Greek astronomer Hipparchus to discover the precession of the equinoxes in 127 BCE. The star lies almost exactly on the ecliptic, meaning it can be occulted by the Moon and, very rarely, by planets. In many ancient agricultural societies, the heliacal rising of Spica marked the beginning of the harvest season. At approximately 12.5 million years old, the stars in the Spica system are relatively young but evolving rapidly due to their high masses, with the primary component likely to explode as a supernova within the next few million years.', 141, 'superuser');
CALL insert_content_revision('Polaris, also known as Alpha Ursae Minoris or the North Star, is the brightest star in the constellation Ursa Minor and the 48th brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent magnitude of 1.98. Located approximately 430 light-years from Earth, Polaris is actually a multiple star system, with the main component being a yellow-white supergiant about 5.4 times the Sun''s mass and 46 times its radius, with a surface temperature of approximately 6,000 K. Polaris is famous for its position less than 1 degree from the north celestial pole, making it an extremely important navigational star throughout human history. As Earth rotates, Polaris appears nearly stationary in the night sky while other stars appear to circle around it. The star is a classical Cepheid variable, pulsating in size and brightness over a period of about 4 days, though its variability has been decreasing notably over the past century, puzzling astronomers. The name "Polaris" comes from Latin meaning "pole star." Due to precession of Earth''s axis, Polaris has not always been, and will not always be, the pole star—around 3000 BCE, the pole star was Thuban (Alpha Draconis), and in about 13,000 years, it will be Vega. The Polaris system includes a close companion, Polaris Ab, discovered in 2006, which orbits the primary star every 30 years, as well as two more distant companions, Polaris B and C. Throughout history, Polaris has been essential for navigation, particularly maritime navigation, and has significant cultural importance across many civilizations.', 142, 'superuser');

The star appears distinctly orange-red to the naked eye, and its isolated position in a relatively dim part of the sky has earned it the nickname "the Solitary One." The name "Alphard" comes from Arabic and means "the solitary one of the serpent," referring to its position as the heart of the serpent in the Hydra constellation. At an estimated age of about 420 million years, Alphard is in an advanced stage of stellar evolution, having exhausted the hydrogen in its core and now fusing helium. The star is a suspected variable, showing small, irregular changes in brightness. Alphard is moving through space at an unusually high velocity compared to nearby stars, suggesting it may have been ejected from a binary system or star cluster earlier in its life. In ancient Chinese astronomy, Alphard was known as "the Bird Star" and was associated with the vermilion bird of the south, one of the four celestial animals in Chinese constellation traditions. Despite its designation as Alpha Hydrae, it is not the most luminous star in Hydra when absolute magnitude is considered—several stars in the constellation are intrinsically brighter but appear fainter due to their greater distance from Earth.', 143, 'superuser');

The primary component is an orange-red giant with about 1.23 times the Sun''s mass and has expanded to about 31 times the Sun''s radius, with a surface temperature of approximately 4,470 K. Its companion is a yellow giant with about 1.19 times the Sun''s mass and 10 times the Sun''s radius, with a surface temperature of approximately 4,980 K. The two stars orbit each other with a period of about 619 years at an average separation of about 170 astronomical units (AU). Even a small telescope can resolve the pair, making Algieba a popular target for amateur astronomers. The name "Algieba" (or "Algeiba") comes from Arabic and means "the forehead," referring to its position in the sickle asterism that forms the head and mane of Leo, the lion. In 2009, astronomers discovered a planet orbiting the primary star, though later analysis has cast doubt on this finding. Both stars in the Algieba system are evolved stars that have exhausted the hydrogen in their cores, with the primary star being further along in its evolution. The contrasting colors of the pair—orange-red for the primary and yellow for the secondary—make Algieba one of the most beautiful double stars in the sky for telescopic observation.', 144, 'superuser');

The primary star has a very close companion with which it forms a spectroscopic binary, completing an orbit every 357 days. A third, more distant companion orbits this pair. The Hadar system is very young, with the primary star being only about 14 million years old, but due to its high mass, it has already evolved off the main sequence and will likely explode as a supernova within the next few million years. The name "Hadar" is derived from Arabic, though its exact meaning is uncertain; the alternative name "Agena" is of modern origin with unclear etymology. Hadar appears close to Alpha Centauri in the night sky, and the two stars serve as important pointer stars to the Southern Cross, one of the most recognizable asterisms in the southern sky. The system is located in one of the brightest parts of the Milky Way and is a member of the Scorpius-Centaurus Association, the nearest OB association to our Solar System. Unlike many bright stars that have been studied for centuries, detailed information about the Hadar system has only been obtained relatively recently due to its position in the southern sky, away from the major astronomical centers of the ancient world.', 145, 'superuser');

The two stars orbit each other extremely closely, completing one orbit every 3.96 days at an average separation of only about 0.08 astronomical units (AU)—less than a quarter of the distance between Mercury and the Sun. This proximity causes the stars to gravitationally distort each other into slight ellipsoidal shapes. Menkalinan is an eclipsing binary, meaning the orbital plane is aligned almost exactly with our line of sight, so each star partially eclipses the other during every orbit, causing a slight dip in brightness that can be detected with precise instruments. The name "Menkalinan" comes from Arabic and means "the shoulder of the rein-holder," referring to its position marking the right shoulder of the charioteer in the constellation Auriga. At about 570 million years old, the Menkalinan system is middle-aged, and both stars have begun to evolve off the main sequence.

Dubhe has a close companion that orbits it every 44 years, as well as a more distant pair of stars that may be gravitationally bound to the system. The star is the northwestern star (the top right star) of the bowl of the Big Dipper asterism, and together with Merak (Beta Ursae Majoris), it forms the "Pointer Stars" that can be used to locate Polaris, the North Star. The name "Dubhe" comes from Arabic and means "the bear," referring to its position marking the back of the Great Bear in the constellation Ursa Major. At about 400 million years old, Dubhe is in an advanced stage of stellar evolution, having exhausted the hydrogen in its core. Unlike the other bright stars of the Big Dipper, which share similar proper motions as members of the Ursa Major Moving Group, Dubhe is not part of this stellar association and is moving in a different direction through space.

CALL insert_content_revision('Alhena, also known as Gamma Geminorum, is the third-brightest star in the constellation Gemini and the 56th brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent magnitude of 1.93. Located approximately 105 light-years from Earth, Alhena is actually a binary star system whose primary component is a white subgiant star with about 2.8 times the Sun''s mass and 3.3 times its radius, with a surface temperature of approximately 9,260 K. The companion is a faint, low-mass star orbiting at a distance of at least 800 astronomical units (AU), with an orbital period estimated to be at least 12,500 years. The primary star is beginning to evolve off the main sequence, having nearly exhausted the hydrogen in its core. The name "Alhena" comes from Arabic and refers to a "brand" or "mark" on a camel''s neck, though the connection to the star is not entirely clear. In the constellation Gemini, Alhena marks one of the feet of the twin Pollux. Alhena is notable for having an unusually low abundance of iron and other metals compared to our Sun, with only about 40% of the Sun''s metallicity. At about 420 million years old, the Alhena system is middle-aged. The primary star is expected to continue evolving into a true giant over the next few hundred million years before eventually shedding its outer layers to form a planetary nebula with a white dwarf remnant at its center. In ancient Chinese astronomy, Alhena was part of an asterism called "The Well," and it has been significant in the celestial navigation and timekeeping systems of various cultures throughout history.', 153, 'superuser');
CALL insert_content_revision('Peacock, also known as Alpha Pavonis, is the brightest star in the constellation Pavo (the Peacock) and the 40th brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent magnitude of 1.94. Located approximately 180 light-years from Earth, Peacock is a blue-white main-sequence star with about 5 times the Sun''s mass and 4.9 times its radius, with a surface temperature of approximately 17,600 K. The star is still in the prime of its life, fusing hydrogen in its core, though due to its high mass, it will have a shorter lifespan than our Sun. The name "Peacock" is simply derived from the constellation in which it resides. The constellation Pavo was created by Dutch navigators Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman in the late 16th century during mapping expeditions of the southern sky, and it was first published by Johann Bayer in his 1603 star atlas Uranometria. Located in the deep southern sky, Peacock never rises above the horizon for observers north of about 32 degrees north latitude, making it invisible from most of Europe and North America. At an estimated age of about 40-50 million years, Peacock is still relatively young. Despite its youth, it rotates relatively slowly for a star of its type, with a projected rotational velocity of about 16 km/s. Peacock is a useful navigational star for southern hemisphere navigators and was one of the 57 stars used in the early space program as navigational references. The star has not featured prominently in mythology largely because it was not visible to the ancient civilizations of the northern hemisphere that developed the most well-known stellar folklore.', 154, 'superuser');
CALL insert_content_revision('VY Canis Majoris is one of the largest known stars in the Milky Way galaxy and one of the most luminous red hypergiant stars ever observed. Located approximately 3,900 light-years from Earth in the constellation Canis Major, VY Canis Majoris is too faint to be seen with the naked eye despite its enormous size and luminosity, with an apparent magnitude ranging from 6.5 to 9.6. The star is a highly evolved red hypergiant with an estimated mass of about 17 times that of the Sun, but has expanded to a radius that may be as large as 1,420 times the Sun''s radius—if placed at the center of our Solar System, its surface would extend beyond the orbit of Jupiter. VY Canis Majoris has a surface temperature of approximately 3,490 K and shines with the luminosity of approximately 270,000 Suns. The star is surrounded by an extensive and complex envelope of ejected material, forming one of the largest known circumstellar nebulae, which extends about 0.25 light-years from the star and contains enough material to form several new stars. VY Canis Majoris is classified as a semiregular variable star, showing irregular changes in brightness over time. At only about 8-10 million years old, VY Canis Majoris has already reached an advanced stage of stellar evolution due to its high mass and is now nearing the end of its life. The star is expected to explode as a supernova within the next 100,000 years, which will be visible from Earth even in daylight when it occurs. VY Canis Majoris represents an extreme case of stellar physics and provides important insights into the final evolutionary stages of the most massive stars in our galaxy.', 155, 'superuser');
CALL insert_content_revision('UY Scuti is currently considered one of the largest known stars in terms of volume and among the most luminous red supergiants in the Milky Way. Located approximately 5,100 light-years from Earth in the constellation Scutum, UY Scuti is much too faint to be seen with the naked eye, with an apparent magnitude varying between 8.29 and 10.56. The star is an enormous red supergiant with an estimated mass of about 7-10 times that of the Sun but has expanded to a radius that may be as large as 1,700 times the Sun''s radius—if placed at the center of our Solar System, its surface would extend well beyond the orbit of Jupiter, reaching nearly to Saturn. UY Scuti has a surface temperature of approximately 3,500 K and shines with the luminosity of about 340,000 Suns, though precise measurements are difficult due to interstellar extinction. The star was first cataloged in 1860 by German astronomers at the Bonn Observatory during their survey of the southern sky, but its extreme size was only recognized in 2012 following observations with the Very Large Telescope. UY Scuti is classified as a pulsating variable star of the semiregular type, with its brightness varying over a period of about 740 days. At an estimated age of only a few million years, UY Scuti has already reached an advanced stage of stellar evolution due to its high mass and is currently fusing helium in its core. The star is losing mass at a prodigious rate through powerful stellar winds, creating an extended envelope of ejected material around it. UY Scuti is expected to end its life in a spectacular supernova explosion within the next million years, briefly outshining entire galaxies when it occurs.', 156, 'superuser');
CALL insert_content_revision('Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. With a diameter of 12,742 kilometers (7,918 miles), Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of 149.6 million kilometers (92.96 million miles), completing one orbit every 365.25 days while rotating on its axis once every 23.9 hours. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. Earth''s outer layer is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over geological time periods, resulting in continents that drift gradually across the planet''s surface. The planet is 70% covered by oceans of liquid water, with the remaining 30% comprising continents and islands. Earth''s atmosphere consists primarily of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), with trace amounts of other gases, providing protection from harmful solar radiation, moderating temperature, transporting water vapor, and providing useful gases for living organisms. Earth''s magnetic field, generated by its molten iron outer core through a dynamo process, deflects most solar wind particles, protecting the atmosphere from being stripped away. The planet''s diverse biosphere has significantly altered its atmosphere and surface features, creating an ecological balance that has enabled the evolution of complex life. Earth has a single natural satellite, the Moon, which formed shortly after Earth about 4.5 billion years ago, likely from the debris of a major collision between Earth and a Mars-sized body.', 161, 'superuser');

Often called the "Red Planet" due to iron oxide prevalent on its surface, Mars has a thin atmosphere and surface features reminiscent of both the Moon and Earth. The planet has polar ice caps, seasonal weather patterns, volcanoes, canyons, and ancient river valleys. Olympus Mons, a shield volcano, is the highest mountain in the Solar System, while Valles Marineris is one of the largest canyons. Mars has two small, irregularly shaped moons: Phobos and Deimos. With a diameter of 6,779 kilometers, Mars completes an orbit every 687 Earth days at an average distance of 228 million kilometers from the Sun. Its day is slightly longer than Earth''s at 24.6 hours. Numerous missions have explored Mars, with rovers like Curiosity and Perseverance currently active on its surface. Evidence suggests Mars once had significant amounts of surface water and may have been habitable in its ancient past. The ongoing search for past or present Martian life remains a major focus of exploration, alongside plans for potential human missions in the future.', 162, 'superuser');
CALL insert_content_revision('Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in our Solar System, with a diameter of 139,820 kilometers—more than 11 times that of Earth. This gas giant contains more than twice the mass of all other planets combined and is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, similar to the Sun. Jupiter lacks a solid surface, transitioning from gaseous outer layers to an increasingly dense, hot interior that may contain a rocky core. The planet''s most distinctive feature is its Great Red Spot, a giant storm system larger than Earth that has persisted for at least 400 years. Jupiter''s atmosphere displays colorful cloud bands and turbulent storms created by strong winds reaching up to 620 kph (385 mph). With the strongest magnetic field in the Solar System (14 times stronger than Earth''s), Jupiter generates intense radiation belts that would be lethal to unprotected humans. The planet rotates faster than any other in our Solar System, completing one rotation in just under 10 hours despite its enormous size, creating a visible equatorial bulge. Jupiter has at least 79 moons, including the four large Galilean satellites—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—first observed by Galileo Galilei in 1610. The planet also possesses a faint ring system, discovered in 1979 by the Voyager 1 spacecraft. Jupiter''s immense gravitational influence has helped shape the Solar System by deflecting comets and asteroids, potentially reducing impact events on Earth.', 163, 'superuser');
CALL insert_content_revision('Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in our Solar System, with a diameter of 116,460 kilometers—nearly 10 times that of Earth. Most famous for its spectacular ring system, Saturn is a gas giant composed primarily of hydrogen and helium. The planet''s most distinctive feature, its rings, extend up to 282,000 kilometers from the center of the planet yet are remarkably thin—typically less than 100 meters thick. These rings consist of countless particles ranging from microscopic dust to bus-sized chunks, composed mainly of water ice with traces of rocky material. Saturn has at least 82 moons, with Titan being the largest—bigger than the planet Mercury and the only moon in our Solar System with a substantial atmosphere. Like Jupiter, Saturn lacks a solid surface, transitioning from gas to liquid to a possible rocky core as depth increases. The planet has the lowest density of all planets in our Solar System—less than that of water, meaning it would theoretically float if placed in a giant bathtub. Saturn''s atmosphere features less visible banding than Jupiter but experiences some of the strongest winds in the Solar System, reaching speeds of 1,800 kph (1,118 mph). The planet rotates quickly, completing one turn in about 10.7 hours, creating a significant flattening at the poles. Saturn radiates 2.5 times more energy than it receives from the Sun, indicating significant internal heat generation. The Cassini mission, which orbited Saturn from 2004 to 2017, revealed complex seasonal changes, dynamic ring processes, and potentially habitable environments on some of its moons.', 164, 'superuser');
CALL insert_content_revision('Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and the third-largest by diameter in our Solar System, measuring 50,724 kilometers across—about four times Earth''s diameter. Unlike the other planets, Uranus rotates on its side with an axial tilt of approximately 98 degrees, likely the result of a massive collision early in its history. This extreme tilt gives Uranus the most unusual seasons in the Solar System, with each pole experiencing 42 years of continuous sunlight followed by 42 years of darkness during its 84-year orbit around the Sun. Uranus is classified as an "ice giant" rather than a gas giant, as its interior contains more water, ammonia, and methane ices than Jupiter and Saturn. The planet''s atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, with a significant amount of methane that absorbs red light and gives Uranus its distinctive pale blue-green color. Uranus has a complex system of at least 13 rings, which are narrow, dark, and difficult to observe compared to Saturn''s brilliant rings. The planet has 27 known moons, all named after characters from the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope. Unlike the other giant planets, Uranus emits very little heat from its interior, making it the coldest planet in the Solar System with a minimum atmospheric temperature of -224°C (-371°F). The only spacecraft to visit Uranus was Voyager 2 in 1986, which revealed a world that appeared featureless at that time, though subsequent observations with advanced telescopes have detected seasonal changes and occasional giant storms in its atmosphere.', 165, 'superuser');
CALL insert_content_revision('Neptune is the eighth and most distant planet from the Sun in our Solar System, orbiting at an average distance of 4.5 billion kilometers. With a diameter of 49,244 kilometers—nearly four times that of Earth—Neptune is the fourth-largest planet by diameter. It is classified as an ice giant like Uranus, with an interior composed largely of water, ammonia, and methane ices beneath its hydrogen and helium atmosphere. Neptune''s vivid blue coloration comes from trace amounts of methane in its atmosphere, which absorbs red light and reflects blue wavelengths. The planet experiences the strongest winds in the Solar System, with speeds reaching up to 2,100 kph (1,300 mph)—faster than the speed of sound on Earth. When Voyager 2 flew by in 1989 (the only spacecraft to visit Neptune), it observed a massive storm system called the Great Dark Spot, similar to Jupiter''s Great Red Spot but which later dissipated. Neptune has at least 14 known moons, with Triton being by far the largest. Triton is unusual because it orbits Neptune in the opposite direction to the planet''s rotation (retrograde orbit), suggesting it was captured from the Kuiper Belt. Neptune also has a faint and complex ring system, consisting of five main rings with several fainter arcs. The planet was the first to be discovered through mathematical prediction rather than direct observation, when irregularities in Uranus''s orbit led astronomers to calculate the position of an unknown planet whose gravity could explain these discrepancies. Neptune completes one orbit around the Sun every 165 Earth years and one rotation every 16 hours.', 166, 'superuser');
CALL insert_content_revision('Pluto is a dwarf planet located in the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies beyond Neptune''s orbit. Discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh, Pluto was originally classified as the ninth planet in our Solar System but was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006 when the International Astronomical Union formally defined the term "planet." With a diameter of just 2,377 kilometers—about two-thirds the size of Earth''s Moon—Pluto is approximately 39 times farther from the Sun than Earth, taking 248 Earth years to complete one orbit. Pluto''s highly elliptical orbit occasionally brings it closer to the Sun than Neptune, as was the case from 1979 to 1999. The dwarf planet rotates on its side, similar to Uranus, with a rotation period of 6.4 Earth days. Pluto''s surface is composed primarily of nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide ices and features a surprising variety of terrains, including smooth plains, mountains reaching up to 3,500 meters, and glaciers of nitrogen ice. The most notable feature is Tombaugh Regio (informally called the "Heart"), a light-colored region rich in nitrogen ice. Despite surface temperatures averaging -229°C (-380°F), NASA''s New Horizons mission, which flew by Pluto in 2015, revealed evidence of past and possibly present geological activity, including cryovolcanoes (ice volcanoes).

CALL insert_content_revision('Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and the only dwarf planet located in the inner Solar System. With a diameter of approximately 940 kilometers, Ceres is the 33rd-largest known body in the Solar System and contains about one-third of the asteroid belt''s total mass. Discovered on January 1, 1801, by Giuseppe Piazzi, Ceres was initially classified as a planet, then an asteroid, and finally designated a dwarf planet in 2006 alongside Pluto. Ceres completes one orbit around the Sun every 4.6 Earth years at an average distance of 414 million kilometers. It rotates on its axis every 9 hours and has a very slight axial tilt of about 4 degrees, resulting in minimal seasonal variations. Unlike most asteroids, which are irregularly shaped, Ceres has sufficient mass for its own gravity to pull it into a spherical shape. The dwarf planet likely has a differentiated interior with a rocky core surrounded by a mantle of ice. In 2015, NASA''s Dawn spacecraft began orbiting Ceres, revealing a cratered surface with notable features including Ahuna Mons, a 4-kilometer-high cryovolcano, and Occator Crater, which contains bright deposits of sodium carbonate—the largest concentration of carbonate minerals found beyond Earth. These bright spots, along with evidence of subsurface liquid water and the detection of organic compounds, suggest Ceres may have been (or still be) capable of supporting prebiotic chemistry and possibly represents a transition between rocky inner planets and icy outer worlds.', 168, 'superuser');
